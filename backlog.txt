Brogue HD Backlog
-----------------

Game View Program Design:

	- (Program) Bottom Menu Bar (includes depth indicator, so is the full length of the screen)
	- (Program) Status Bar (left side) (two programs)
		-> One monster list scrollable program (dynamic sizing)
		-> One player status program
		** The search bar will be permanently shown
			-> [   Search   ]  (fills up when player searches) (all menu items are sub-programs)
			
	- (Program) Flavor Text
	- (Program) Game View (may just end up being a single program)
	- (Program) Menu (non-scrollable)
	- (Program) Inventory (non-scrollable) (dynamic sizing)
	- (Program) Hover Text (dynamic sizing / positioning)
	- (Program) Brogue Log Text (dynamic sizing / scrolling / data setting with scroll)
	- (Program) Modal Program (generic, and with UI Tag actions, generic views can change game state)
	- (Program) Command (Help) Display
	- (Program) Discovered Items Display
	
Player Status Panel:

	- TODO: Add name of player to the game data, and display it proudly. 
	
Brogue UI State:

	Definition: The UI state which will accept user interaction.
	
	enum class brogueUIState
	{
		MainMenu = 0,
		OpenMenu = 1,
		PlaybackMenu = 2,
		HighScores = 3,
		Modal = 4,
		GameNormal = 5,
		GameLogOpen = 6,
		GameMenuOpen = 7,
		GameInventoryOpen = 8,
		GameDiscoveredItemsOpen = 9,
		GameHelpOpen = 10
	};
	
Brogue UI Animation Sequence: (brogueUIStateChanger)

	Definition: The UI animation would be something that affects only the UI elements.  
				So, a non-game animation.
				
	- This animation data class would be a single instance held by the openglRenderer. Any UI
	  interaction could start a UI animation sequence.
	  
	- The beginning and end points of an animation sequence will correspond to a UI state. 
	
	- Each UI state will have a user interaction (state) associated with it. So, normal 
	  gameplay would be one of those states.
	  
	- brogueUIAnimation (enum class)
		- GameLogScrollOpen
		- GameLogScrollClose
	  
	- brogueUIStateChanger:
		- brogueUIState startState
		- brogueUIState endState
		- brogueUIAnimation animation
		- bool pending
		- bool running
		// State Specific (these will be animation data)
		- int gameLogScrollOffset
