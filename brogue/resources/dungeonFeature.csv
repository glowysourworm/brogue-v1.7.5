# bloods
# Start probability is actually a percentage for bloods.
# Base probability is 15 + (damage * 2/3), and then take the given percentage of that.
# If it's a gas, we multiply the base by an additional 100.
# Thus to get a starting gas volume of a poison potion (1000), with a hit for 10 damage, use a starting probability of 48.
