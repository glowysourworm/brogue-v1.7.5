# brogue-v1.7.5
Rebuild of Brogue v1.7.5 for purposes of creating a Brogue-like engine. Starting at the beginning with 
customized OpenGL, plenty of specific container classes, and some fine tuned control over the basics.

Plans include:
  - Fully working serialized file of the game data
  - Editor for game configurations (e.g. v1.7.5 game parameters, instead of hard coded data)
  - Multiple-level handling simultaneously for any engaged character
  - Support for server-mode games

A "Brogue Editor" will accompany the project - probably built in C# to start with - but likely as
a web application - which will be easily translated to an online environment.
